## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a data engineer specializing in building scalable data solutions using Apache Spark. This repository showcases a range of projects centered around ETL pipeline development, performance tuning, and distributed computing â€” all essential components of modern big data engineering.

At the core of my work is designing robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using PySpark and Spark SQL. Each project demonstrates how I ingest data from diverse sources, perform complex transformations, and load the cleaned data into storage systems or downstream applications. I pay particular attention to data schema design, partitioning strategies, and fault tolerance to ensure the pipelines are reliable, maintainable, and efficient at scale.

Performance optimization is a critical part of working with big data, and it plays a major role in these projects. I leverage Sparkâ€™s optimization features such as Catalyst and Tungsten, and implement best practices like predicate pushdown, caching, broadcast joins, and using DataFrames over RDDs. I also experiment with tuning Spark configurations â€” adjusting executor memory, number of partitions, and shuffle settings â€” to achieve better performance in real-world scenarios.

In addition, this repository includes examples that highlight distributed computing techniques. I utilize Sparkâ€™s ability to process data in parallel across clusters to handle high-volume datasets. Projects explore how distributed joins, aggregations, and window functions can be performed efficiently while maintaining scalability. I also incorporate monitoring and logging to track job execution and detect performance bottlenecks.

These projects aim to serve as practical references for engineers and data professionals working with large-scale data processing. Whether you're new to Apache Spark or looking to deepen your understanding of ETL workflows and distributed data systems, I hope you find the content here insightful and applicable to your own data engineering challenges.
